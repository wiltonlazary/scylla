/* This module contains classes and functions used to manage CDC generations:
 * sets of CDC stream identifiers used by the cluster to choose partition keys for CDC log writes.
 * Each CDC generation begins operating at a specific time point, called the generation's timestamp
 * (`cdc_streams_timpestamp` or `streams_timestamp` in the code).
 * The generation is used by all nodes in the cluster to pick CDC streams until superseded by a new generation.
 *
 * Functions from this module are used by the node joining procedure to introduce new CDC generations to the cluster
 * (which is necessary due to new tokens being inserted into the token ring), or during rolling upgrade
 * if CDC is enabled for the first time.
