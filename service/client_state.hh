     * Returns a timestamp suitable for paxos given the timestamp of the last known commit (or in progress update).
     *
     * Paxos ensures that the timestamp it uses for commits respects the serial order of those commits. It does so
     * by having each replica reject any proposal whose timestamp is not strictly greater than the last proposal it
     * accepted. So in practice, which timestamp we use for a given proposal doesn't affect correctness but it does
     * affect the chance of making progress (if we pick a timestamp lower than what has been proposed before, our
     * new proposal will just get rejected).
     *
     * As during the prepared phase replica send us the last propose they accepted, a first option would be to take
     * the maximum of those last accepted proposal timestamp plus 1 (and use a default value, say 0, if it's the
     * first known proposal for the partition). This would mostly work (giving commits the timestamp 0, 1, 2, ...
     * in the order they are commited) but with 2 important caveats:
     *   1) it would give a very poor experience when Paxos and non-Paxos updates are mixed in the same partition,
     *      since paxos operations wouldn't be using microseconds timestamps. And while you shouldn't theoretically
     *      mix the 2 kind of operations, this would still be pretty nonintuitive. And what if you started writing
     *      normal updates and realize later you should switch to Paxos to enforce a property you want?
     *   2) this wouldn't actually be safe due to the expiration set on the Paxos state table.
     *
     * So instead, we initially chose to use the current time in microseconds as for normal update. Which works in
     * general but mean that clock skew creates unavailability periods for Paxos updates (either a node has his clock
     * in the past and he may no be able to get commit accepted until its clock catch up, or a node has his clock in
     * the future and then once one of its commit his accepted, other nodes ones won't be until they catch up). This
     * is ok for small clock skew (few ms) but can be pretty bad for large one.
     *
     * Hence our current solution: we mix both approaches. That is, we compare the timestamp of the last known
     * accepted proposal and the local time. If the local time is greater, we use it, thus keeping paxos timestamps
     * locked to the current time in general (making mixing Paxos and non-Paxos more friendly, and behaving correctly
     * when the paxos state expire (as long as your maximum clock skew is lower than the Paxos state expiration
     * time)). Otherwise (the local time is lower than the last proposal, meaning that this last proposal was done
     * with a clock in the future compared to the local one), we use the last proposal timestamp plus 1, ensuring
     * progress.
     *
     * @param min_timestamp_to_use the max timestamp of the last proposal accepted by replica having responded
     * to the prepare phase of the paxos round this is for. In practice, that's the minimum timestamp this method
     * may return.
     * @return a timestamp suitable for a Paxos proposal (using the reasoning described above). Note that
     * contrary to the get_timestamp() method, the return value is not guaranteed to be unique (nor
     * monotonic) across calls since it can return it's argument (so if the same argument is passed multiple times,
     * it may be returned multiple times). Note that we still ensure Paxos "ballot" are unique (for different
     * proposal) by (securely) randomizing the non-timestamp part of the UUID.
