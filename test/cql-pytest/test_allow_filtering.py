# Tests for the "ALLOW FILTERING" specification on SELECT requests.
# ALLOW FILTERING is required in specific cases, but not required
# (but allowed) in other cases.
#
# Our documentation, https://docs.scylladb.com/getting-started/dml/, states
# that queries that do not need ALLOW FILTERING "have predictable
# performance in the sense that they will execute in a time that is
# proportional to the amount of data returned by the query (which can be
# controlled through LIMIT).".
#
# Note that we have several "xfail"ing tests below. They fail because in
# those cases Scylla does not live up to its own documented definition -
# either we don't require ALLOW FILTERING on a query that may produce only
# a few results and yet need to go over millions of partitions to produce
# them, or the opposite problem: a query which can be done in time
# proportional to the result size wrongly requires ALLOW FILTERING.
#
# Most of the tests below go beyond just checking whether ALLOW FILTERING
# is required: The tests also check that when the query is allowed, its
# results are the correct filtered subset of the entire content of the table.

# Moreover, these functions also test that result of the request, when
# allowed, is the correct result. We check this by comparing the result of
# the request with what we will get by filtering in Python the entire
# contents of the table ('everything') with the given 'filt' function.
