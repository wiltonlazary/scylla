/**
 * The view_builder is a sharded service responsible for building all defined materialized views.
 * This process entails walking over the existing data in a given base table, and using it to
 * calculate and insert the respective entries for one or more views.
 *
 * We employ a flat_mutation_reader for each base table for which we're building views.
 *
 * We aim to be resource-conscious. On a given shard, at any given moment, we consume at most
 * from one reader. We also strive for fairness, in that each build step inserts entries for
 * the views of a different base. Each build step reads and generates updates for batch_size rows.
 *
 * We lack a controller, which could potentially allow us to go faster (to execute multiple steps at
 * the same time, or consume more rows per batch), and also which would apply backpressure, so we
 * could, for example, delay executing a build step.
 *
 * View building is necessarily a sharded process. That means that on restart, if the number of shards
 * has changed, we need to calculate the most conservative token range that has been built, and build
 * the remainder.
 *
 * Interaction with the system tables:
 *   - When we start building a view, we add an entry to the scylla_views_builds_in_progress
 *     system table. If the node restarts at this point, we'll consider these newly inserted
 *     views as having made no progress, and we'll treat them as new views;
 *   - When we finish a build step, we update the progress of the views that we built during
 *     this step by writing the next token to the scylla_views_builds_in_progress table. If
 *     the node restarts here, we'll start building the views at the token in the next_token column.
 *   - When we finish building a view, we mark it as completed in the built views system table, and
 *     remove it from the in-progress system table. Under failure, the following can happen:
 *          * When we fail to mark the view as built, we'll redo the last step upon node reboot;
 *          * When we fail to delete the in-progress record, upon reboot we'll remove this record.
 *     A view is marked as completed only when all shards have finished their share of the work, that is,
 *     if a view is not built, then all shards will still have an entry in the in-progress system table,
 *   - A view that a shard finished building, but not all other shards, remains in the in-progress system
 *     table, with first_token == next_token.
 * Interaction with the distributed system table (view_build_status):
 *   - When we start building a view, we mark the view build as being in-progress;
 *   - When we finish building a view, we mark the view as being built. Upon failure,
 *     we ensure that if the view is in the in-progress system table, then it may not
 *     have been written to this table. We don't load the built views from this table
 *     when starting. When starting, the following happens:
 *          * If the view is in the system.built_views table and not the in-progress
 *            system table, then it will be in view_build_status;
 *          * If the view is in the system.built_views table and not in this one, it
 *            will still be in the in-progress system table - we detect this and mark
 *            it as built in this table too, keeping the invariant;
 *          * If the view is in this table but not in system.built_views, then it will
 *            also be in the in-progress system table - we don't detect this and will
 *            redo the missing step, for simplicity.
